# P7 MyReads Project - Front-end Udacity scholarship

I was provided a static example of the CSS and HTML markup , without any of the React code that was needed to complete the project. My job was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code.

## Running the application

1.  Clone this repository and install all project dependencies with `npm install`
2.  Launch the project by starting the development server with `npm start`, this should open the App in the browser

## Backend Server

The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods I used to perform necessary operations on the backend.

## Important - Search terms

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
